            <h5>Posted Oct 12, 2018</h5>
            <h2>What is a portfolio/showreel?  </h2>
            <h3 style="font-style: italic">Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Within the Creative Technologies sector, a portfolio is a collection of materials that exemplifies
                the owner’s skills, qualifications, and or education.  These materials mostly consist of static
                documents or images that the owner considers to be a showcase of their best work.</p>

                        <br/>

            <h3 style="font-style: italic">Showreel</h3>
            <p>A showreel aims to do much the same although usually comes in the form of a video that is carefully
                composited to show the owners best work in action.  Just like a movie trailer it gives a concise but
                    captivating impression of the owner’s abilities within their given field.<br/></p>
                <br>
            <h2>Do game developers need a portfolio/showreel?</h2>
            <p>I would have to say yes, and to both!  From my own personal experience of applying to game development
                positions, there has never been one job advert that I have applied for that never requested a demo of
                my work.  By stating “demo”, does that mean that you only post code examples, since the potential
                employer is looking for a demonstration of your coding skills?</p>
            <p>Some would consider a showreel too artistic to include for a game developer, however, I think that it
                would be best way to present your finished coded examples.  Allow that potential employer to see a
                visual implementation of your code.</p>
            <h3 style="font-style: italic">The numbers don't add up!</h3>

                    declined by 65% since 2014. Exemplified in this statement posted on <a href="

                <p>With these numbers in mind it only goes to show that the competition for a job in game development right
                    now is extremely fierce.  Therefore, it only makes sense to have portfolio/showreel that makes you
                    stand out from the crowd.  Also, to help back this up even further below is an excerpt from
                    <a href="https://www.gamedesigning.org/career/game-design-portfolio/">gamedesigning.org</a></p>
                <div class="itals">“A portfolio is the easiest and most effective way for you to show off the relevant work
                    that you’ve done. The fact that most designers have their own portfolio somewhere on the web would mean
                    that you’ve put yourself at a disadvantage by not making one yourself.”<br/></div>

            </div>
            <h3 style="font-style: italic">Getting Noticed</h3>
            <p>To make your work stand out there are a few factors in my opinion that invariably count. First and
                foremost is that person viewing the portfolio should be drawn in by your best work. Personally, I don’t
                think that you should limit yourself to only your best work for display, as a wide range of work can
                show diversity.  </p>

                <!--<br/>-->
            </div>
            <p>Bearing in mind that you want to engage your viewer, therefore, the best examples should never be more
                than a click away from your landing page. The next main factor is relevancy. The main body of your
                portfolio should signify to the viewer that you are aiming towards a particular field. Since we are
                discussing this from a game developers’ point of view, it would make more sense to post the best
                examples of your games you have created first. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="text/css">
                <P>This could be in the form of short video clips, source code posted via repository/version control
                    software like GitHub or even links to access your own GDDs (Game Design Documents).  If you put items
                    like beautiful 3D models, sprites or 2d stills in the forefront, the viewer is more likely to think you
                    are an artist or modeller rather than developer.  This does not mean that you should exclude these types
                    of work.  Creative and wise organisation will make sure that they are not contributing to that ever so
                    important first impression, yet still show your potential for diversity within the field. </P>
            </div>
            <h3 style="font-style: italic">Summary</h3>
            <P>To conclude this post, I would urge anyone looking to apply for a position in Game Development to take
                note of key points above.  They are by no means set in stone regulations that you must follow, but
                merely an opinion formed through experience and investigation into the subject.  Who would you hire for
                the position, the person with real tangible evidence of their ability,
                or roll the dice and hope for sixes?</P>
